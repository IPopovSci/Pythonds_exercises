'''You
are
given
the
heads
of
two
sorted
linked
lists
list1 and list2.

Merge
the
two
lists in a
one
sorted
list.The
list
should
be
made
by
splicing
together
the
nodes
of
the
first
two
lists.

Return
the
head
of
the
merged
linked
list.

Example
1:

Input: list1 = [1, 2, 4], list2 = [1, 3, 4]
Output: [1, 1, 2, 3, 4, 4]

Example
2:

Input: list1 = [], list2 = []
Output: []

Example
3:

Input: list1 = [], list2 = [0]
Output: [0]

Constraints:

The
number
of
nodes in both
lists is in the
range[0, 50].
-100 <= Node.val <= 100
Both
list1 and list2
are
sorted in non - decreasing
order.
